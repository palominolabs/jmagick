 0. Prequisite.
       - GNU Autoconf if you get the source from the CVS server
       - The JMagick build scripts makes very extensive use of
         GNU Make 3.77.
       - A ANSI C compiler. The GNU or EGCS compiler is recommended.
       - ImageMagick 5.5.7.
       - A Java2 JDK. However, JMagick was developed with Sun JDK 1.4.1.

 1. Unpack the JMagick tar file.

        > tar xvfz JMagick-5.5.7-X.tar.gz

 2. Make the JMagick distribution directory current.

        > cd JMagick-5.5.7-X

 3. Not strictly required but required if you use the CVS server.
    You might want to run autoconf:

        > autoconf

 4. Make sure that java, javac, jar, gcc are in your path.
    Run the configuration script.

        > ./configure

    The configuration script has the following options:

        --prefix=<path>
            The root path where the installation goes. For example,
             to install the libraries into /usr/local/jmagick/lib,
             use --prefix=/usr/local/jmagick

        --with-magick-home=<path>
            Use this if your have ImageMagick install in non-standard places.
            E.g. ./configure --with-magick-home=/usr/local/ImageMagick

        --with-java-home=<path>
            Use this to specify where your JDK is installed. This is NOT
            necessary if you have the JAVA_HOME environment set.
            E.g. ./configure --with-java-home=/usr/local/java

        --with-java-includes=<path>
            Use this to specify a Java include directory.

        --with-jikes
            If you wish to use the IBM Jikes compiler instead

        --enable-diagnostic
            If you want verbose messages. Only a few messages are available
            at the moment.

        --with-javadoc-dir=<path>
            To specify a directory path for the javadoc.

 5. Then make everything.

       > make all

 6. To install the binaries run:

      > make install

 7. To use JMagick, libJMagick.so must be in a directory where the
    runtime loader can find it or you must set the environment variable
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH. jmagick.jar must be in your Java class path.

 8. Examples and some tests can be found in src/test. Simply:

       > make test

 9. To generate Javadoc documentation in HTML, run:

       > make javadoc

NOTES
~~~~~

 1. If you pulled the source from the CVS server, the make might failed
    the first time you run it because GNU Make fails inference rules
    when directories are not created yet. Try running make after the
    failure.
