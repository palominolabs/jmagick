  * First version on SourceForge.net
  * Renamed package test to magicktest and moved utility class MagickWindow to magick.util
  * configure.in now claims version is 6.3.8

  * A few tweaks to the output lib names to support version numbers and symlinks.
  For example, it outputs libJMagick-6.2.6.dylib and a link called libJMagick.dylib (.so's on Linux).
  An option to the configure.in offers an arg --with-shared-lib-ext=.dylib.

  * The ImageMagick wasnt initialized from JMagick!
    Called MagickCoreGenesis and now environment variables also work

  * Removed obj/magick from version control. We do not want objects inside.
  * Changed all RelinquishMemory casts to void* (this needs some testing)
  * Reverted RelinquishMemory casts back to void** <- should have thought
  about it haha
  * Fixed compile error in magick_MagickImage.c at line 3390 onwards: Please
  compile code before committing.
  * Renamed RelinquishMemory to RelinquishMagickMemory.... I am so sure it was
  RelinquishMemory in the docs.... OH WELL!


2007-06-26  Jacob Nordfalk
  * Update broken setColorProfile() and setIptcProfile() so they dont use
    deprecated IM557 color_profile and iptc_profile members.
    (reference http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9063);


2007-06-20 Ian Michell
  * Replace deprecated LiberateMemory with RelinquishMemory to avoid crash
    (reference http://www.yeo.id.au/mailman/private/jmagick/2007-June/002591.html);


2007-xx-xx Jacob Nordfalk
  * Updated ColorspaceType to reflect that IM had changed values
